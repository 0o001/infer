title: Infer static analyzer
id: home
excerpt: >
  Infer is a static analysis tool - if you give Infer some Java or C/C++/Objective-C code it produces a list of potential bugs. Anyone can use Infer to intercept critical bugs before they have shipped to users, and help prevent crashes or poor performance.

## Using Infer

Start with the [Getting Started](docs/getting-started.html) guide and our other [docs](docs/) to download and try
Infer yourself.

Infer is still evolving, and we want to continue to develop it in the open.

We hope it will be useful for other projects, so please try it out or contribute to it, join the
community and give us feedback!
