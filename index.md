## What is Infer?

Facebook Infer is a static analysis tool - if you give Infer some Objective-C, Java, or C code, it 
produces a list of potential bugs. 

Anyone can use Infer to intercept critical bugs before they have shipped to people's phones, and 
help prevent crashes or poor performance.

## Who Uses Infer?

It is used as part of the Facebook development process, where it runs on code changes for mobile 
apps - these include the main Facebook apps for Android and iOS, Facebook Messenger, Instagram, WhatsApp,
and other apps which are used by over a billion people.

In addition to Facebook, where Infer is being developed, Infer is used by a number of companies:
